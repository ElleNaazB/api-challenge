This project is consist is broken down into two parts : <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/api-challenge/blob/main/WeatherPy.ipynb">WeatherPy <a>and <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/api-challenge/blob/main/VacationPy.ipynb">VacationPy</a>.

# Part 1: WeatherPy

<a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/api-challenge/blob/main/WeatherPy.ipynb">WeatherPy <a> looks at the weather in over 500 cities around the world, using tools like the citipy library and the OpenWeatherMap API to gather information. This project makes it easy to see how the weather changes depending on proximity from the equator. The script creats plots to showcase the relationship between Weather Variables and Latitude and to show the link between where a city is located and things like how hot or cold it is, how much it rains, how cloudy it is, and how windy it gets. The project also did performs mathematical operations todetermin the relationships more clearly, especially focusing on the difference between cities in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

# Part 2: VacationPy
<p>In the second part of this project <a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/api-challenge/blob/main/VacationPy.ipynb">VacationPy</a>  does a visualizations by using the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library. The script  incorporates the necessary libraries and loads the CSV file containing weather and coordinates data for each city, as established in Part 1.</p>
